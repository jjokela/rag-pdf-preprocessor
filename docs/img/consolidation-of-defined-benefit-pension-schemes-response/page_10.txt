The page appears to be from a document discussing procedures related to a Superfund. The focus of the page is on outlining the scenarios under which a Superfund may trigger certain levels of review and intervention due to funding and capitalisation issues. Key points include:

- Superfund managers are allowed to resume taking on new business as normal if required authorization funding levels are met.
- A Level 1 trigger involves scenarios where funding and capitalisation fall below a certain level, prompting an assessment of whether the Superfund or individual Section's funding can be restored without needing to close it to new trustees or transfer liabilities to another Section.
- A Level 2 trigger is more critical, associated with a substantial probability of the Superfund assets falling below a minimum threshold, which could require a suspension of certain operations until solutions such as capital injections or expense reductions are implemented.
- It is also mentioned that Superfunds will have the opportunity to correct issues before reaching the minimum, with discretion limited to certain corrective action if interventions are triggered. This indicates a process of progressive steps to prevent the Superfund from reaching critical financial states.

The introduction of "PRP Wind Up Trigger" at the bottom of the page is likely a continuation of a topic discussed on a previous page, with details around the trigger following in the subsequent section. Overall, the document seems to concern financial management and contingency measures for a Superfund.
