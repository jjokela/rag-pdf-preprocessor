The provided image appears to be page 37 of a PDF document discussing regulations related to transferring into a Superfund and the associated gateway considerations for the process. It outlines specific concerns and principles that need to be considered before proceeding with such transfers.

Key points from the page:

1. It highlights risks associated with transferring into a Superfund due to potential regulatory arbitrage between different regulatory frameworks (e.g., bank and insurance regulations). There is a need for a 'gateway' to manage these risks.

2. The gateway is designed as a mechanism to ensure that only transfers beneficial to members are permitted. The regulatory body would assess prospective consolidations against a set of standards and criteria before allowing the transfer.

3. The document lists the proposed set of principles that would govern the eligibility of schemes for joining a Superfund, such as:
   - Schemes should not transfer into a Superfund if they could afford to buyout the entitlements.
   - Transfers should reduce the risk of member benefits not being paid and increase the likelihood of full benefit payment over retaining the scheme.
   - Schemes should avoid transferring if it could lead to an uneven distribution of resources among members.

4. It is suggested that active schemes (with contributing members) should not be allowed to transfer unless no better outcome can be achieved, and the risk of the scheme unable to provide full benefits is high.

5. The document discusses the considerations of resources required to meet the scheme's liabilities and mentions that the regulatory body could impose conditions regarding the management and governance of the transfers.

This page seems to provide a foundational framework for the policy-making related to Superfund transfers, with a strong emphasis on protecting the interests and benefits of the members of the schemes involved.
