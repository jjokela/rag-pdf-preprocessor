The image displays a page from a document with a section titled "Proposed Regime - Key Features," specifically focusing on the "Schemes in Scope."

Section 11 outlines that the government proposes that only Superannuation (super) schemes of significant size should qualify for inclusion in a new system to provide better outcomes for members. The rationale is that particularly large funds are most capable of delivering high-quality, efficient services due to economies of scale.

A visual aid in the form of a chart details 'Buyout funding level' ranging from 95-100% and 'Expected Schemes in scope'. This indicates that schemes closer to a full buyout funding level are expected to transition into the proposed system.

There's a subsection on 'Size', which elaborates that the intention behind focusing on larger schemes isn't merely about size but the quality of outcomes that these larger schemes can deliver due to strong governance, better engagement with investment markets, and potential cost advantages.

In paragraph 12, there is a recognition that the proposed regime should not arbitrarily limit the scale of schemes to the extent that it prevents potentially successful schemes from entering the market. Any restrictions should be designed to balance the need for efficiency and the opportunity for different providers to compete effectively.

Lastly, the page concludes with a footer indicating it is page 5 of the document.
