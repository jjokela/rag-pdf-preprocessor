The image shows a page from a PDF document which includes text and a pie chart figure related to a consultation on Superfunds. The text describes a consultation process that took place on December 7, 2018, regarding the consolidation of Defined Benefit schemes. The main focuses of this consultation involved the regulatory requirements and the role of The Pensions Regulator (TPR) in relation to Superfunds. There is a mention of a high level of interest and a wide array of respondents to the consultation.

The text references an Annex A, where more detailed responses to the consultation are provided, and suggests that the feedback received will be used to inform some key features such as sustainability standards, the assessment of a Superfund's financial strength, and operational safety.

Figure 1 on the page, titled "RESPONDENTS BY TYPE," is a pie chart that visually represents the types of respondents to the consultation. It shows that Advisers/Consultants make up the majority at 30%, followed by Pension Schemes at 28%, and the category marked "Other" at 22%. Industry Bodies represent 14% of the respondents, while Employers account for the smallest group at just 6%.

Paragraph 29, which is partially visible, seems to be discussing the progress made following the consultation, specifically mentioning close work with stakeholders including actuaries, lawyers, and insurance industry representatives. There are brief bullet points regarding items for discussion, focusing on the size of a capital buffer and the rules governing investment risk management, specifically relating to the protection of members' benefits.

The content reflects stakeholder engagement and a phase of policy development for Superfunds within pension schemes, signalling the complexity and seriousness of the regulatory framework being considered.
