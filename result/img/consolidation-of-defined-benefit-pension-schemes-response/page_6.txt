The image shows a page from a PDF document with the title "Proposed Regime - Key Features" and the heading "Schemes in Scope." The content on this page outlines certain key features of a proposed regime related to superannuation funds, with specific attention paid to which schemes will be covered by this regime.

Under "Schemes in Scope," it is mentioned that the government is hoping that all superannuation schemes will be captured by the new regime and that it may opt for a phased implementation, starting with the largest schemes first.

The document includes a chart under "Expected Schemes in scope," which categorizes buyout funding levels into different percentage brackets (95-100%+, 90-95%, and 50-90%) and gives a brief explanation of the schemes expected to fall within these levels. For instance, schemes close to a buyout level are not anticipated to face substantial interaction with the funding regime.

There is also a section on "Size," which discusses the importance of the size of a superfund on the regime's outcomes. The government is considering the possibility that some superfunds may not reach the required size to be fully operational without support and cooperation from others. The bottom part of the page emphasizes that the proposed regime should not be overly restrictive, as this could hinder the success of the best-funded schemes.
