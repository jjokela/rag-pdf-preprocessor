The image is of a document discussing the process of transferring into a Superfund and the associated gateway considerations. It outlines a set of principles that would govern the eligibility of schemes to join a Superfund. These principles touch on areas such as:

A. Schemes should not transfer if they can support the benefits of members for the foreseeable future through self-sufficiency.
B. Schemes should not transfer if they have sufficient assets to afford buyout, the decision to move should benefit members and compare the value of new benefits against the old scheme.
C. There is a focus on the calculation of the transfer value, which should reflect the realistic expectation of receiving full benefits.

The page emphasizes that the transfer value must take into account the level of security offered by the Superfund and the cost associated with achieving a similar level of security in the transferring scheme. There are also mentions of various aspects to consider, like the economies of scale and the potential impact on members' benefits.

The document appears to be addressing regulatory or policy concerns regarding pension funds or similar financial schemes, specifically relating to how schemes merge or transfer into a larger Superfund, ensuring that members' interests are safeguarded in the process.
